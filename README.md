# Retail-Store-Expansion-Analysis
Analysed the Data to provide recommendation to retail store for their international expansion

A retail store chain in the United States of America is thinking of expanding to other countries and want to figure out which countries are similar economically, demographically, education, and environment to the United States of America.

I am trying to to segment the countries of the world based on various economic, demographic, education, and environment data. From this I should be able to provide a list of countries that are similar to the United States. This will be the “short list” for further consideration by management.

Data set is acquired from "World Bank Web Site https://databank.worldbank.org/databases.aspx?qterm=&pagenumber=1.
A clean version of this data is included with the supporting materials.
